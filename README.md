# Arrow Pad Keyboard


 
This repo allows you to build custom keypad keyboard. 


There are 2 versions of PCB design due to chip shortage. Folder "VIMorKeypad_Keyboard" contains STM Cube IDE project which can be compiled for every ÂµC and keybinding can be also modified. "main.c" is just main code in STM Cube IDE project.


All THT compoents should be on the top side and all the SMD on the bottom side.

I'll throw some pictures of the real thing after everything is finished and tested.
